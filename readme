These samples use Angular 6.0.4

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) Install Bazel

2) run npm install

3) Terminal 1: run npm run start-remote-cache
This starts a remote caching server that can be used by the application build.

4) Terminal 2: npm run start or npm run start
npm run start does a Bazel run without watching for file changes. Running npm run start-watch will watch files for changes.

In both cases, if caching is enabled, previously built artifacts will be returned by the caching server.

The application is hosted at http://localhost:3000
