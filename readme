These samples use Angular 6.0.4

Live DEMO here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-samples
Documentation: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-articles

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) npm install

2) npm run start
   
-This builds the application using Bazel and serves it from http://localhost:3000


Optinally you can also build a set of samples where I compare bundling options:

1) Closure Compiler (requires Java): npm run closure-compiler-demo

2) Rollup: npm run rollup-demo: npm run rollup-demo 

3) Webpack (AoT without lazy loading): npm run webpack-no-lazy-loading

4) Webpack (AoT with lazy loading): npm run webpack-lazy-loading

5) Webpack (Babili): npm run webpack-babili

6) Parcel: npm run parcel-demo

7) Browserify: npm run browserify-demo

8) Rollup with lazy loading: npm run rollup-lazy

You can build all options by running npm run build-all
