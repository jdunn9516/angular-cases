These samples use Angular 7.0.1

Live DEMO here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-samples
Documentation: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-articles

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) run npm install

2) Terminal 1: run npm run start-remote-cache
This starts a remote caching server that can be used by the application build.

3) Terminal 2: npm run start
Starts a bazel build with file watching (iBazel).

In both cases, if caching is enabled, previously built artifacts will be returned by the caching server.

The application is hosted at http://localhost:3000
