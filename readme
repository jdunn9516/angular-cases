These samples use Angular 6.0.4

Live DEMO here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-samples
Documentation: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-articles

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) npm install

2) npm run start
   
-This builds the application using Bazel and serves it from http://localhost:3000
-The Bazel build runs inside docker container, so Docker is a requirement to run these samples

Optinally you can enable a remote Bazel caching server to speed up builds.
The caching server can be started by running npm run start-remote-cache. Then uncomment the build/run definitions in tools/bazel.rc.
