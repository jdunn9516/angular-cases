These samples use Angular 6.0.4

Live DEMO here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-samples
Documentation: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-articles

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) npm install

2) Terminal 1: run npm run start-remote-cache
- This starts a remote caching server that can be used by the application build.

3) Terminal 2: npm run start
- This starts a Bazel build of the api server and the Angular dev server.
  If caching is enabled, previously built artifacts will be returned by the caching server.

The application is hosted at http://localhost:3000
