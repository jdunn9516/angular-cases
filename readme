These samples use Angular 4.1.2

Live DEMO here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-samples
Documentation: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-articles

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) npm install && bower install

2) npm run build-demo-app && npm start
   
   -AOT compiles
   -Tree shakes 
   -Bundles app into single file


Steps 1 and 2 builds the demo application.


Optinally you can also build a set of samples where I compare bundling options:

1) Closure Compiler (requires Java): npm run closure-compiler-demo

2) Rollup: npm run rollup-demo: npm run rollup-demo 

3) SystemJS (JiT and no bundling): npm run systemjs-demo

You can build all options, including the main app, by running npm run build-all
