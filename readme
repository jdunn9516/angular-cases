These samples use Angular 5.1.2

Live DEMO here: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-samples
Documentation: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/angular-2-articles

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) npm install && bower install

2) npm run build-demo-app && npm start
   
   -AOT compiles
   -Tree shakes 
   -Bundles app into single file (Rollup)


Steps 1 and 2 builds the demo application.


Optinally you can also build a set of samples where I compare bundling options:

1) Closure Compiler (requires Java): npm run closure-compiler-demo

2) Rollup: npm run rollup-demo: npm run rollup-demo 

3) SystemJS (JiT and no bundling): npm run systemjs-demo

4) SystemJS-Builder (JiT with bundling): npm run systemjs-builder-demo

5) Webpack (AoT without lazy loading): npm run webpack-no-lazy-loading

6) Webpack (AoT with lazy loading): npm run webpack-lazy-loading

7) Webpack (Babili): npm run webpack-babili

8) Parcel: npm run parcel-demo

You can build all options, including the main app, by running npm run build-all
